## Implement a Graph

**This is a Solo assignment**
<!-- short description of project -->
Today you will be learning and implementing a new abstract data structure: Graphs.

## Specifications
<!-- Write a spefication for the features required in this lab assignment -->

### Setup
- Create a new branch in your `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository called `graph`.
- Create a new directory called `graph/`, with all of your standard module configuration for each directory
    - `__init__.py`, `README.md`, etc.
- Copy the provided starter code from lecture to a file called `graph.py`

### Features
- In `graph.py`:
    - Complete the provided scaffold implementation for your Graph

### Testing
- You are required to maintain an 80% or better coverage benchmark in your test suite.
- Start by focusing on three different tests/assertions for each method that you create on your graph, including the initial class definition.
    - One assertion should validate successful functionality
    - One assertion should validate failure functionality
    - One assertion should validate an edge case


## Submission
1. Create a pull request from your feature branch to your `master` branch.
2. In your open pull request, leave as a comment [a checklist](https://github.com/blog/1825-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents){:target="_blank"} of the specifications, with the actual specifications you completed checked off.
3. Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the Canvas assignment for this day.
4. Leave any comments you may have about the assignment in the comments box. This includes any difficulties you may have had with the assignment.
5. Merge your feature branch into `master`

## Rubric
- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions.

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	7       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution |
	5       | Program meets all of the  functionality requirements described above (including tests) // Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors|
	4       | Program meets most of the functionality requirements described above (including tests)  // Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	3       | Program missing most of the functionality requirements described above // Program runs/compiles |
	2       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors // Required naming conventions not met |
	0       | No Submission |

- 3pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	3       | Code meets Industry Standards // method and variable names are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are properly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented // Frequent Commits |
	2       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments // minimal or no commits |
	1       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
