# Presentation Guidelines

## VISUALLY Test your presentation:
- Since your teams should now have MVP in place and are focusing more on layout, design, and stretch goals today, take a few minutes at some point to go to a classroom (or even better, the main event space) and take a look at your app on a projector/screen setup.
- Decide whose machine you will use to present with, test its functionality, then test a second laptop just in case.
- For this part of presentation testing, focus only on how it looks. Play with functionality only as a means of generating different views.
- Make sure to look at every page, and take detailed notes of what you want to adjust (text size, text color, contrast between foreground and background, etc.). **REMEMBER: The way that it looks on your laptop is often not how it looks on screen!**
- You’ll be glad you did this step of visual testing.
- This is often a moment of, “THAT’S not what we want it to look like!”, so the sooner you do it the better.


## Plan your presentation... have a script:
- Shoot for a presentation of 10 minutes; under no circumstances should you exceed 15 minutes.
- It is better to leave your audience wanting more than make them wish you would finish already.
- Expect to take a few minutes after your 10 minutes to answer audience questions (and there will be questions!).
- Each person should briefly introduce themselves: first and last names, your background, and your goals with studying code.
- Decide on who will say what during the presentation. It may be helpful to write up an outline of the presentation beforehand.
    - Who will give an intro, and tell us about the problem domain and your team’s solution? In other words, the MC?
    - Who will talk about the functionality, and walk us through a demo of the app?
    - Who will show us the code when you are showing off a technical challenge you overcame?
    - Tell us about at least one thing you found challenging, and one thing you really enjoyed working on.
    - Each person should tell us some of what they contributed to the project and how that fit into the whole.
    
    
## Rehearse your presentation:
- One rehearsal is not enough (at least do it twice); ten is too many. Somewhere in there is the right number for your team.
- One of the instructional team can coach you through the process if you ask: we’ve all done this before.
- Set a timer and take turns talking through your topics so you know how much time each segment will take.
- If your team finds it is going over 10 minutes, refactor or trim out some pieces.
- Practice with the microphone so that you are comfortable with it and know how far to hold it from your face.
- Be careful of walking around with the microphone: if you step directly in front of the speakers there is a risk of feedback.
- Make sure to practice how you intend to present; speak clearly, don’t keep your hands in your pockets, stand up straight, etc.


## The actual presentation
-   Showcase your product and your team as if you were trying to sell them, or gain investors. Highlight the functionality, not the broken pieces.
-   There will be video recordings of the presentations that will go on YouTube.
-   No need to go formal, but dress reasonably nice.
-   Show that you take the presentation process seriously: BE PROFESSIONAL!
-   Think of your presentation as something you’d like a hiring manager to see. That might end up being the case!
-   Speak clearly, and speak a little more slowly than you ordinarily would.
-   Avoid using slang or profanity.
-   Don’t give your presentation while holding a beer in your hand, chewing gum, etc.
-   Unless it’s specifically requested, don’t show your code! Audience members don’t have the context to understand what you’ve done within your short presentation time.


## Overall time breakdown:
- 10 minutes - Intro/demo
- 5 minutes - Technical challenge
- 5 minutes - Q&A
