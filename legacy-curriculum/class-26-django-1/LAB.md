- create django app named `snickers`
  - Note: replace `candy` etc. with names of your choice


## Features

- Create web site with 2 pages
  - home page
  - about page
  - create views/urls/templates as needed for home and about pages
  - use ancestor template to contain navigation elements
  - Follow the typical steps covered in class demo for building site

      - define app
      - add app to project
      - add views

## Rubric

- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions.

	Points  | Reasoning |
	 ------------ | :-----------: |
	7       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution |
	5       | Program meets all of the  functionality requirements described above (including tests) // Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors|
	4       | Program meets most of the functionality requirements described above (including tests)  // Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	3       | Program missing most of the functionality requirements described above // Program runs/compiles |
	2       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors // Required naming conventions not met |
	0       | No Submission |

- 3pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning |
	 ------------ | :-----------: |
	3       | Code meets Industry Standards // method and variable names are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are properly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented // Frequent Commits |
	2       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments // minimal or no commits |
	1       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
