## Title
Deploy your Django application to EC2

**This is a Pair assignment**
<!-- short description of project -->

## Specifications
<!-- Write a spefication for the features required in this lab assignment -->
Today you'll be deploying the Django application you've built to AWS EC2 using all of the tooling and containerization we've learned about this week!

### Setup
- Follow the instructions [Here](./notes/deployment.md){:target="_blank"} to deploy your application
- _Note: Ensure that you ask for help today. DevOps is a tedious process with many steps, and it's easy to lose track of your state along the way._

### Testing
- You are required to meet or exceed an 80% coverage benchmark for this application

## Submission
1. Copy the link for your EC2 DNS and paste it into the Canvas assignment for this day.
2. Leave any comments you may have about the assignment in the comments box. This includes any difficulties you may have had with the assignment.

## Rubric
- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions.

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	7       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution |
	5       | Program meets all of the  functionality requirements described above (including tests) // Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors|
	4       | Program meets most of the functionality requirements described above (including tests)  // Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	3       | Program missing most of the functionality requirements described above // Program runs/compiles |
	2       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors // Required naming conventions not met |
	0       | No Submission |

- 3pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning |

	3       | Code meets Industry Standards // method and variable names are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are properly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented // Frequent Commits |
	2       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments // minimal or no commits |
	1       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
