## Deploy your application to AWS

**This is a Pair assignment**
You will be deploying your application to a Platform as a Service called Elastic Beanstalk today. 

## Specifications


### Setup
- Ensure that you've installed the [awsebcli](https://pypi.org/project/awsebcli/) as a developer dependency in your project.
- Check that your CLI was installed correctly: `eb --version`

### Features
- Using the ElasticBeanstalk CLI, configure you application for deployment to EB. 
- ON AWS: Configure an Elasticache cluster with the same security group as your EB deployment, and make sure to add the redis endpoint to your EB configurations.  


### Testing
- No test requirements for this lab.

## Submission
1. Copy the link for your ElasticBeanstalk DNS and paste it into the Canvas assignment for this day.
2. Leave any comments you may have about the assignment in the comments box. This includes any difficulties you may have had with the assignment.


## Rubric
- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions.

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	7       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution |
	5       | Program meets all of the  functionality requirements described above (including tests) // Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors|
	4       | Program meets most of the functionality requirements described above (including tests)  // Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	3       | Program missing most of the functionality requirements described above // Program runs/compiles |
	2       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors // Required naming conventions not met |
	0       | No Submission |

- 3pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	3       | Code meets Industry Standards // method and variable names are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are properly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented // Frequent Commits |
	2       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments // minimal or no commits |
	1       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
