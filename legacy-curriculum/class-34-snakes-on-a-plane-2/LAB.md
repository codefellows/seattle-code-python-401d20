## Snakes on a Plane II

**This is a Solo  assignment**

Note: Pair/group work is fine, but submit individually

<!-- short description of project -->
Add a front end to your Snakes on a Plane application. Adapt back end to support concept of `cells` in a `grid`

## Specifications
<!-- Write a spefication for the features required in this lab assignment -->
- Add a `frontend` repository to your `snakes-on-a-plane` organization.
- Create a React application in `frontend` repository that displays a collection of `cells` that represent different graphical elements of an airplane.
- Rename `api` repository to `backend` to avoid doubled up naming.
- Adapt your `api` to handle updated data needs.
	- Add `Cell` model and api routes to support it
	- Add `Player` model and api routes to support it
- Map out game logic for moving about cabin using `bubbl.us` or an alternate tool.
	- Make list of rules for how player can NOT move may be good place to start

### Stretch
- Add Snake to plane
- Begin coding (in Python) for player movement logic

### Testing
- No testing requirements


## Submission
1. Create a pull request from your feature branch to your `master` branch.
2. In your open pull request, leave as a comment [a checklist](https://github.com/blog/1825-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents){:target="_blank"} of the specifications, with the actual specifications you completed checked off.
3. Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the Canvas assignment for this day.
4. Leave any comments you may have about the assignment in the comments box. This includes any difficulties you may have had with the assignment.
5. Merge your feature branch into `master`

## Rubric
- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions.

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	7       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution |
	5       | Program meets all of the  functionality requirements described above (including tests) // Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors|
	4       | Program meets most of the functionality requirements described above (including tests)  // Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	3       | Program missing most of the functionality requirements described above // Program runs/compiles |
	2       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors // Required naming conventions not met |
	0       | No Submission |

- 3pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	3       | Code meets Industry Standards // method and variable names are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are properly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented // Frequent Commits |
	2       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments // minimal or no commits |
	1       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
