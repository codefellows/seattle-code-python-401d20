## Data Visualization

**This is a Solo  assignment**

<!-- short description of project -->
Analyzing data is awesome. But how do we share the fruits of that analysis? Visualize it of course! Let's use Bokeh to not only make things look awesome but even be interactive to boot.

## Specifications
<!-- Write a spefication for the features required in this lab assignment -->
Using the excellent [Bokeh tutorials](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bokeh/bokeh-notebooks/master?filepath=tutorial%2F00%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Setup.ipynb){:target="_blank"} as a guide present interesting conclusions/explorations about video game sales.

### Setup
- Create a repo named `data-visualization`
- Sign up for a Kaggle account (if you don't already have one).

### Features
- Find and download the following data set:
    + [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales){:target="_blank"} - Sales data from more than 16,500 games
- Visualize 3 conclusions/explorations in different ways
	- E.g. bar chart, scatter plot, histogram
- Add interactive features
	- E.g. hover tooltips

### Stretch
- Use a different data set. There are tons of them, get wacky. 
- Add a JavaScript callback


## Submission
1. Create a pull request from your feature branch to your `master` branch.
2. In your open pull request, leave as a comment [a checklist](https://github.com/blog/1825-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents){:target="_blank"} of the specifications, with the actual specifications you completed checked off.
3. Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the Canvas assignment for this day.
4. Leave any comments you may have about the assignment in the comments box. This includes any difficulties you may have had with the assignment.
5. Merge your feature branch into `master`

## Rubric
- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions.

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	7       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution |
	5       | Program meets all of the  functionality requirements described above (including tests) // Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors|
	4       | Program meets most of the functionality requirements described above (including tests)  // Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	3       | Program missing most of the functionality requirements described above // Program runs/compiles |
	2       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors // Required naming conventions not met |
	0       | No Submission |

- 3pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	3       | Code meets Industry Standards // method and variable names are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are properly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented // Frequent Commits |
	2       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments // minimal or no commits |
	1       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
