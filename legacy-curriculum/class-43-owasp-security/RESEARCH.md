## Research and Present One of the OWASP Top 10 Security Risks

**This is a research assignment which you will present**
<!-- short description of project -->
You will be assigned a topic below, which you will research and provide a 10 minute presentation for during the lecture period for class 43. The topic of your research project has been detailed within the 2017 OWASP Securities Report found [here](https://www.owasp.org/images/7/72/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf){:target="_blank"}, though you will need to expand your research area past this report.

1.  A3:2017-Sensitive Data Exposure
1.  A4:2017-XML External Entities (XXE)
1.  A5:2017-Broken Access Control
1.  A6:2017-Security Misconfiguration
1.  A7:2017-Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
1.  A8:2017-Insecure Deserialization
1.  A9:2017-Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
1.  A10:2017-Insufficient Logging&Monitoring


## Specifications
<!-- Write a spefication for the features required in this lab assignment -->

### Setup
- Create a repository called `owasp_research_demo` for the code demo(s) that you will use during your presentation
- Create a slide deck in the software of your choice; PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi, etc.
    - *Note: Your deck must be made available online; either hosted on a live site, submitted as a file in your repo, or both*

### Features
- Develop a 10 minute (maximum) presentation, which you will deliver to your classmates and instructional staff, detailing the assigned security risk.
    - Introduce your topic and delivery your materials in the form of a slide deck presentation
        - Detail any supporting information that you've gathered about what the risk is, why it's important, how it can be mitigated, and any other relevant details
    - Provide supporting examples in code; either through a web application or code snippets

### Testing
- Any code demos you provide must be fully tested. Your tests will be a powerful support tool to show both the vulnerabilities and the solutions for managing those risks in a web application.


### Stretch goal
- Write a blog post! It's never to early to start getting your brand out there online, and this is a great starting point!


## Submission
1. Create a pull request from your feature branch to your `master` branch.
1. A link to your presentation slide deck, or the deck itself, must be available in your repository.
1. Copy the link to your repository and paste it into the Canvas assignment for this assignment.
1. Leave any comments you may have about the assignment in the comments box. This includes any difficulties you may have had with the assignment.
