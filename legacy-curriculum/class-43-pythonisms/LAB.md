## Diving deeper into Python features

### This is a Solo assignment

## Specifications

- Create examples demonstrating `pythonic` language features. For example...
  - Use iterators/generators on a custom collection to...
    - add ability to be use in a `for in` loop
    - add ability to be used in a list comprehension
    - add ability to convert to a list or other collection type
  - Create a decorator that adds behavior to a given function. For example...
    - Calculate the time spent in the function
    - Log relevant info for debugging purposes
    - Slow down the function
    - Convert the return value in some way
    - Validate some condition on the way in
  - Use dunder methods make your code more readable and elegant. For example...
    - add ability for two custom data structure to be considered equal
    - add ability for custom data structure to be considered truthy/falsy
  - Anything else that catches your interest
  - Describe your findings in README
  - Optionally create your project as a Jupyter Notebook if you prefer
    - In that case add tests as asserts within Notebook

### Setup

- create a `pythonisms` repository on Github

### Testing

- Create unit tests for new features

### Stretch Goals

- Research Python 3.8 features
- Check out [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/){:target="_blank"} or [PyRight](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright){:target="_blank"} and report back.

## Rubric

- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions.

	Points  | Reasoning |
	 ------------ | :-----------: |
	7       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution |
	5       | Program meets all of the  functionality requirements described above (including tests) // Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors|
	4       | Program meets most of the functionality requirements described above (including tests)  // Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	3       | Program missing most of the functionality requirements described above // Program runs/compiles |
	2       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors // Required naming conventions not met |
	0       | No Submission |

- 3pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning |
	 ------------ | :-----------: |
	3       | Code meets Industry Standards // method and variable names are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are properly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented // Frequent Commits |
	2       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments // minimal or no commits |
	1       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
