## Open Source Contributions with Operation Code

### This is a Solo or Group assignment

## Specifications

- Review open issues on the repo.
- Check the pending Pull Requests so you don't duplicate other's work.
- Make a contribution...
  - Identify any bugs or missing features and fix them.
  - Add/clarify documentation
  - Add unit tests
  - Give usability feedback

### Setup

- Read documentation at [Operation Code](https://github.com/OperationCode/Start_here){:target="_blank"}

### Testing

- Create unit tests as appropriate for contribution. You definitely want to know your feature works before you ask them to pull in the change!

### Stretch Goals

- Find other Open Source projects to contibute to.


## Submission

1. Copy the link for your github pull request to Operation Code and paste it into the Canvas assignment for this day.
2. Leave any comments you may have about the assignment in the comments box. This includes any difficulties you may have had with the assignment.


## Rubric

- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions.

	Points  | Reasoning |
	 ------------ | :-----------: |
	7       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution |
	5       | Program meets all of the  functionality requirements described above (including tests) // Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors|
	4       | Program meets most of the functionality requirements described above (including tests)  // Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	3       | Program missing most of the functionality requirements described above // Program runs/compiles |
	2       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors // Required naming conventions not met |
	0       | No Submission |

- 3pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning |
	 ------------ | :-----------: |
	3       | Code meets Industry Standards // method and variable names are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are properly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented // Frequent Commits |
	2       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments // minimal or no commits |
	1       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
