# Discussion Submission Instructions

- The notes you take during 401 are valuable and deserve to live on after the course is over.
- Create a repository for them so you can come back to the questions/ideas/issues later in your career.
- Give the repository a name like "discussion-notes" for example. The exact name is up to you.
  - You can add a **401** folder if you like, but use the organization that makes sense to you.
- Deploy your site on Github Pages.
- For your discussion assignments each day create a new page (or more) for your notes.
- In Canvas submit a link to your new notes on Github Pages.
  - E.g. https://awesomedev.github.io/reading-notes/401/401-02
