# README Layout
Hereâ€™s an example of a README.md. This is about as simple as it should get. Once we get talking about Travis CI and Coveralls as integrations to your application build system, you can include the badge(s).

```md

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

Each section should be formatted to provide clear syntax for usage, example calls including input data requirements and options, and example responses or return values. -->
